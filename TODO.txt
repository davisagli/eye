It's probably time to write some tests...

Icons:
 - tuple
 - list
 - dict
 - persistent object
 - other object
Stats:
 - object size
 - # of loads (???)
 - total size
 - size by class
 - # of transactions in history
Issues:
 - Should probably include various object aspects instead of just picking one
 - Detect object cycles
 - Can we prevent weird shit happening via descriptors?
Other features:
 - Pretty fonts
 - Show file name, basic stats
 - Batched tree for large containers
 - ZEXP export
 - Browse object history
 - Authentication
 - Can you imagine if it was fulltext-searchable and editable? OMG!
 - Re-root the tree
 - Show contained objects in right panel?
 - Option to hide builtins
 - Show docstrings, code when available
